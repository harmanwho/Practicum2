# Introduction

This practicum assignment creates a relational database using MySQL for the publicly available IMDB dataset. 

## ERD Diagrams

### Initial diagram
The following is an ERD diagram of the IMDB database after reading data description and normalization.

### Futher normalized diagram
The following is an ERD diagram of the IMDB database includes added attributes, junction and look-up tables.

We can guarantee this model represents the data in at least BCNF because it fulfills the requirements for all normal forms up to and including BCNF.
Exception: As mentioned in the Rubric - ```title.akas``` & ```title.principals``` are attempted to normalize but might be an exception due to the complexity.

First Normal Form: Each column contains atomic values.  
Second Normal Form: The table is in first normal form and all the columns depend on the table's primary key.  
Third Normal Form: The table is in second normal form and all of its columns are not transitively dependent on the primary key.  
BCNF: The table is in third normal form and for any dependency A -> B, A is a super key.
