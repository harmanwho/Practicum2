The following is an ERD diagram of the IMDB database after normalization.

We can guarantee this model represents the data in at least BCNF because it fulfills the requirements for all normal forms up to and including BCNF.

First Normal Form: Each column contains atomic values.  
Second Normal Form: The table is in first normal form and all the columns depend on the table's primary key.  
Third Normal Form: The table is in second normal form and all of its columns are not transitively dependent on the primary key.  
BCNF: The table is in third normal form and for any dependency A -> B, A is a super key.
